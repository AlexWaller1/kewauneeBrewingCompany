/* 

Basic idea is that this is a website for a 
restaurant/brewery 

what we want for the site

- a welcoming index page

- user authentication

- a menu where can order for pickup

- a cart for the order 

- a page that simulates a purchase

- well designed with some smooth artwork

- a weather api so customers can make informed
decisions about outdoor seating
